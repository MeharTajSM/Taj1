    <h2>Artificial intelligence</h2>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn.[1] It is a
        field of study which tries to make computers "smart". John McCarthy came up with the name, "Artificial
        Intelligence" in 1955. Intelligence allows an organism to act in a meaningful way in its environment. It
        includes the ability to get sensory inputs, and to react to these. Artificial intelligence is also about
        processing information and about storing knowledge. One of the goals of "artificial intelligence" is to make a
        machine that behaves in a similar way.


        The authors of Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach agree with Turing that AI must be defined in terms of
        "acting" and not "thinking".[3] However, they are critical that the test compares machines to people.
        "Aeronautical engineering texts," they wrote, "do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that
        fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'"[4] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that
        "Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence".[5]</p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled)
      programming language with first-class functions. While it is most
      well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
      environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe
      Acrobat.
